A table website to showcase my Angular+Node.js+MySQL knowledge and experiences, as well as to update my current knowledge and include a few new technologies/practices. This website is a lite example of what I've made in a professional enviroment. With most knowledge already attained, some reusable code and a few new things, this project took ~50 hours to complete. With just the basic knowledge of the frameworks, this would be a ~250 hour project.

Functionality of the website:

Technology and practices:
  - Frontend:
    - Angular -> Showcase my current knowledge and experience
    - Ag-grid -> N/A
  - Backend:
    - Node.js + Express.js -> Update my current knowledge and practices, improve testing and the use of some libraries
  - Database:
    - MySQL -> N/A
  Other:
    - bcrypt (authentication) -> Implement authentication with this library, simple, but I haven't used it before
    - JWT (authorization) -> Revisit JWT and implement the entire authorization flow
    - Docker -> Get familiar with Docker
